blank.ch – is a learning-focused image board project that I'm building to explore how modern web applications work under the hood. Inspired by classic anonymous boards, the site allows users to create threads and post images with comments, all dynamically managed through a backend and a database. The goal is to get hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend logic like routing, file uploads, and database interactions. It's not just about the visuals—I'm also learning about performance, accessibility, and how to structure a scalable project.
